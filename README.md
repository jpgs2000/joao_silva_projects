Hi, my name is Jo√£o Pedro Silva, and I'm studying Physics Engineering at the University of Lisbon in Portugal. My interests are in programming, especially Python, Physics, and Math. 
In this repository, I will show you 5 Python projects that I have been working on over time:
- Inside the folder **simulation spring** is a program that simulates a physics system with three balls connected with strings between two walls. The result of the animation is saved inside a **.gif** file.
- In the folder **arbitrage betting** is a project that gets the games and respective odds from three bookmakers and tries to find arbitrage opportunities.
- In the file **euromillions.ipynb** I created a simulation of the EuroMillions lottery to test two strategies: keeping the guess for each bet and the other is changing the guess.
- Inside the file **grasping_analysis.ipynb** I create two classes to calculate, using the **Sympy** library, two important matrixes, and respective Null and Column space for grasping analysis of robotic hands.
- Finally, in the file **neural_networks.ipynb** I create two types of Neural Networks using the **Numpy** library with just one hidden layer: one has just one output and another can have several outputs.
