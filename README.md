Hi, my name is Jo√£o Pedro Silva, and I'm studying Physics Engineering at the University of Lisbon in Portugal. My interests are in programming, especially Python, Physics, and Math. 
In this repository, I will show you 6 Python projects that I have been working on over time:
- Inside the folder **simulation spring** is a program that simulates a physics system with three balls connected with strings between two walls. The animation's result is saved as a **.gif** file.
The folder **arbitrage betting** contains a project that gets the games and respective odds from three bookmakers and tries to find arbitrage opportunities.
Inside the folder **twitter_classification_project ** is a Machine Learning project from a Codecademy course that analyzes a series of data from different tweets and users. I tried to predict whether a person is popular based on some information about the user's profile.
- In the file **euromillions.ipynb** I created a simulation of the EuroMillions lottery to test two strategies: keeping the guess for each bet, and changing the guess.
- Inside the file **grasping_analysis.ipynb** I created two classes to calculate, using the **Sympy** library, two important matrices, and their respective Null and Column spaces for grasping analysis of robotic hands.
Finally, in the file **neural_networks.ipynb**, I create two types of Neural Networks using the Numpy library with just one hidden layer: one has just one output, and the other can have several outputs.
